title: "This Meritocracy Fantasy is Bullshit"
---

I've been a programmer professionally for nearly ten years. I enjoy it, it pays well, the benefits are great, and I think more people should consider it as a career. Nearly all of my success has been due to a combination of luck and personal networking, which are just another set of words that mean "privilege, usually white." That's why it makes me so angry to see the backlash within our community against diversity programs.

I started college in 2001 as an English major. By my sophmore year, I was miserable, and probably should have seen a therapist, but I was stubborn and decided to change my major instead. My parents were patient with me, as I gathered up brochures from topics I was mildly interested in, flipped a few quarters, and landed on Information Systems and an extra year of college. Dumb luck.

I made friends with several of my professors, and especially enjoyed talking to my Distributed Systems professor. Because we liked having coffee together, and I needed a couple extra credits, he offered to supervise me for an independent study, where I would "review a relatively new web framework," Ruby on Rails. All this meant was that I would work through the 2nd edition of Agile Web Development with Rails on my own, and at the end of the semester we'd talk about whether he should use it in his next class.

I liked the framework, and this lead to my first job out of college, as a Ruby on Rails developer. This was very lucky, because Rails was exploding in popularity, and I was able to get in on the ground floor. My resume improved, and after a few years a recruiter found me and I moved on to a larger company. My third job was with a friend's hardware startup; we'd met at a local meetup while I was working at my first job. My fourth job was found via a recommmendation from a coworker from my first job. All of this filled up my resume on LinkedIn quite nicely, which lead to a recruiter tracking me down for my fifth (and current) job at Braintree.

All of this came easy. I don't remember ever spending more than two weeks on a job search, I just waited for the offers to come to me. I don't remember ever having significant difficulty with an interview, either I just walked in via recommendation, or I had happened to memorize the right trivia. I made a good amount of money, I worked a sane amount of hours, I worked for companies that gave me fantastic benefits, all because I flipped a quarter in 2003 and it came up "heads" instead of "tails," and my parents were financially able to support a 5th year at college.

During my career, my network of friends and peers has grown. I met new friends at each job I worked at, went to several conferences, and attended lots of local meetups. I recommended several people in my personal network for other jobs; sometimes they took the job, other times they were happy where they were, but thankful for the opportunity. My advocacy directly lead to tens of thousands of dollars in salary increases for multiple people in my network.

Almost every single one of them were white dudes.

Because most of the people I know in my field are white dudes, I'm more likely to introduce white dudes to more white dudes. Because most of the people they know are white dudes, they're more likely to introduce me to even more white dudes. And now, after ten years, nearly all my friends and peers are white dudes.

When someone asks me, "Hey, do you know anybody looking for a job?" most likely I'll name a white dude. When someone asks a friend the same, if they name someone they met through me, it will almost certainly be yet another white dude. This is not "merit." This is a network of white dudes, helping each other out, because they're friends and they know each other.

Privilege isn't overt. You don't get a job _just_ because you're a white dude. You still have to work hard, impress people, get things done. But that's just a salary. Privilege is more like compounding interest. It grows itself, feeds off itself, makes itself stronger and worth more just by existing. And, if you're not paying attention, it reinforces itself over time, making it harder and harder to see through it and recognize it for what it is.

There are millions of white dudes with stories similar to mine, and the network we create is vast and difficult to change from within. Without active diversity programs supported by the programming community, I probably _won't_ be able to expand my network to include many minorities, despite having the desire to. There simply aren't enough natural avenues for me to meet a lot of minority programmers.
