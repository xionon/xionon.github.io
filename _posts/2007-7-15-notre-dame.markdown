When I started at Notre Dame, my main responsibility, Conductor, was in serious trouble. The application crashed regularly, performance was beyond terrible, and nobody could tell me what was actually wrong with it.

Since then, I've solved a multitude of problems:

  * Before me, it took 45 minutes to deploy new versions of Conductor.
  
    After me, it takes 5 minutes.

  * It used to take 200-300 milliseconds, on average, for the program to respond to a request.
  
    It now takes 100 milliseconds at worst.

  * It used to crash about once every month; each crash took 3-4 hours to recover from.
  
    Over the last 6 months, Conductor has crashed twice, and each recovered in less than 15 minutes.

  * Conductor used to cost $3,000 per month in server costs.

    Conductor now costs less than $1,000 per month.

By all measures, my time at Notre Dame has been astonishingly successful. Even so, I don't feel like I'm quite done, creatively speaking. There are a lot of things that I feel I haven't finished: a significant number of problems left to solve. The painting isn't finished.
